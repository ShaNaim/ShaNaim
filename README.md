# ðŸ‘‹ Hello There, I'm Shanaim Shourov!

I'm a **Web Developer** based in Bangladesh with a keen eye for minimalism and brutalist web design. With over a year of experience Iâ€™ve developed strong skills in both the technical and creative aspects of web development. Currently, Iâ€™m focusing on building software solutions that not only enhance user experiences but also drive efficiency for businesses.

### ðŸŽ¯ My Goals

Iâ€™m driven by a passion for **problem-solving, business intelligence**, and **software engineering**. My goal is to transition fully into a Software Engineer role where I can collaborate with innovative teams to build meaningful and impactful solutions. Iâ€™m open to part-time and remote opportunities where I can continue to grow and contribute to projects that value creativity, dedication, and synergy.

### ðŸ’¡ My Stack

-   **Languages**: **JavaScript** , **TypeScript**.
-   **Libraries**: React , ExpressJS.
-   **Tools**: VS Code , Figma.

### ðŸŒ± Outside the Code

Iâ€™m a **burger enthusiast**, a **nature wanderer**, and an **art appreciator**â€”with a surprising soft spot for astrophysics (because who doesn't enjoy contemplating the mysteries of the universe while debugging?). When I'm not lost in code or the cosmos, youâ€™ll find me relaxing with family, chilling with friends, or dreaming up new ways technology can change the world... or at least make life a little easier.
