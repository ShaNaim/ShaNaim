# 👋 Hello There, I'm Shanaim Shourov !
I'm a Web Developer from Bangladesh who turns coffee into code and bugs into existential crises. With over a year of experience, I've mastered the art of staring at a screen for hours, only to realize I was debugging the wrong file.

I love minimalism and brutalist design—because who needs fancy UI when you can have raw, unstyled JSON responses? I can break things equally well on frontend and backend . Whether it's crafting sleek, efficient interfaces or optimizing database queries that were previously running on pure hope, I enjoy making software that works smoothly (and occasionally, on the first try).
I live by the golden rule of backend development: _"If it works on my machine, it's officially your problem now."_ From handling API requests like a pro to writing SQL queries that don’t accidentally wipe the production database, I thrive on building scalable and robust systems—while wondering why every bug fix creates two new ones.

### 🌱 Outside the Code

I'm a hardcore burger enthusiast and a part time 😪 gamer , with an unexpected side quest in astrophysics (because let’s be honest—debugging and black holes have a lot in common). When I'm not lost in code or contemplating the meaning of existence, you’ll find me chilling with family, cracking jokes with friends, or plotting how to use technology to take over the world… or at least make my life slightly more convenient. 🚀🍔🎮
